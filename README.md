# ASCII-Tetris
## using ncurses

A version of Tetris that runs in the terminal using ASCII characters. It is heavily based on [OneLoneCoder's C++ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA) as I followed his tutorial. However, my version is completely in C and runs on Mac and Linux.
The included Makefile should build the binary. Use `make` to build for Unix-like systems. (Mac and Linux)

### Prerequisites:
* A Unix-like OS
* the ncurses library
* clang (only on Linux, or switch the Makefile CC to gcc)

### Windows
You are welcome to try and compile to Windows :).
